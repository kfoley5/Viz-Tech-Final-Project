                <p>Welcome to insta data; an exploration of my Instagram discover feed and 
                    how the personal information Instagram collects translates to the content 
                    they show me. </p>    
                
                <p>This analysis was done by taking a screenshot of my discover feed every day for 28 days
                    and categorizing the content into overarching themes and focusing on the three most prevelant: "Cooking", "Netflix", and "Film." 
                    I then downloaded data from Instagram to access their “Topics” list that they
                    they have curated for me based on my activity. </p>

                <p>Navigate the page by selecting a cateogory to see its prevelance on my discover feed,
                    the percentage of my feed that the selected category took up, and the number of relevant Instagram "Topics."
                    There are 28 empty frames represnting a screenshot of my discover feed on a given day. As you navigate through 
                    the categories, only the cells in which a picture from that category existed will be highlighted.
